Program Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an architecture quiz game/application made for the Architecture Teacher at Klein Oak High School. This program was designed to educate Architecture students in a fun way. A powerpoint was provided by the teacher with images of pieces of architecture, the corresponding names, and various facts about the buildings.

I was tasked with engineering a piece of software that would allow the teacher to educate his students in an engaging way.

I chose to randomize the question order so as to ensure that the students were learning the names of buldings based on the images, rather than in an arbitrary order.

I implemented a scoring system, allowing both the student and teacher to see progress, and giving the option the teacher to grade the students efforts.

Another major part of the design was the inclusion of clues for every question. I took the various facts from the powerpoint and turned them into clues. When a student is stuck on a question, he or she can choose to get a clue/hint. Each hint deducts the maximum possible score a student can get for that particular question. If a student were to use all of the clues, but still answered the question incorrectly, the student would get no points for that question.
